   - Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
   - Use TypeScript for all frontend code

2. **Modularization**:
   - Separate concerns with clear module boundaries
   - Create reusable components and services
   - Keep each class and function focused on a single responsibility

3. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for all critical functionality
   - Backend: pytest for unit and integration tests
   - Frontend: React Testing Library for component tests

4. **Security**:
   - Security-first mindset for all code contributions
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization

5. **Documentation**:
   - Document all public APIs and components
   - Include docstrings for all functions and methods
   - Keep README and other documentation up to date

6. **Performance**:
   - Optimize database queries
   - Use indexing for frequently queried fields
   - Minimize bundle size with proper imports

7. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure all UI components are keyboard navigable
   - Use appropriate ARIA attributes
   - Maintain proper contrast ratios
   - Support screen readers

8. **Code Review**:
   - All code changes must be reviewed before merging
   - Enforce branch protection in repository
   - Use pull requests for all changes
